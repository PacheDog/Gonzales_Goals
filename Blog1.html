					<h2 class="section-title">Replacement?</h2>
						<p>Behind the screens of many, a <b>hidden conflict</b> is taking place. With AI being used more and more recently, IT professionals have voiced their concerns. From companies choosing to <i>replace personnel with AI</i>, many are <b>displeased and anxious</b> about the future. Just how much and how far will <b>AI</b> be used to try to <b>replace us?</b> This blog aims to shed light and break down the details to this rising issue. </p>

					<h2 class="section-title">Anxiety Creeps In</h2>
						<p>Even before OpenAI released <b>ChatGPT</b>, AI were already present but they were not as <i>smart or interactive</i> as today. From being <b>simple chatbots</b> that we once used in our childhood, it has now evolved to a level where we ask it for help in <b>all fields</b>. When I was young, we had a programming lesson. At the time, it felt so amazing that it was possible to <i>communicate and manipulate the computer using programming languages</i>. But now, even without learning those specialized languages, we are now able to communicate directly. Here is where the <b>anxiety comes in</b>, as a <i>student taking bachelor's in computer science</i>, it has been a <b>real worry</b> that after graduating, we wouldn't see any purpose or task for us. Hearing that many IT specialists are being <b>replaced by AI</b> makes it feel like technology is <b>leaving us behind</b> when we were supposed to be the one exploring and improving it. In a world where everything seems to move so fast and <b>stopping is a ticket to obselence</b>, what if you're already running in the direction you thought to be, but suddenly the road you're stepping on is going faster than you. It gives a sense of <b>meaninglessness and purposelessness</b>, that your hard work for years is just quickly being created by something <b>not even another human</b>. </p>

					<h2 class="section-title">The Rat Race</h2>
						<p>With that negative statement, it is clear that AI has a <b>massive impact</b> of all of us. Some positive, some negative, but to others much more negative. In this situation, improving and striving is the only choice. It has become a <b>rat race</b> to see who would <b>come out on top first</b>. But to that one success, many more are <b>left behind in the dark</b>. Lost and afraid with no end in sight. <b>Forever struggling</b>, wondering <i>if they made the right choice in their life</i>.</p>
